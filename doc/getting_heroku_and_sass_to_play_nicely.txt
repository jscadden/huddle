Getting Heroku and Sass to Play Nicely

Problem: Heroku is a (mostly) read-only file system, whereas Sass needs to be able to compile stylesheets.

Solution: Tell Sass to compile its stylesheets into Rails's tmp directory, which happens to be read-write.  While this directory can be emptied without notice, Sass should detect that and recompile on the fly.  This will give a slight delay to users, but is probably worth it, and much easier than trying to wire in Amazon S3 or the like.

Great, how do we do that!

In config/initializers/heroku_sass.rb:

  require "fileutils"

  if !ENV["HEROKU_TYPE"].blank?
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(Rails.root.join("tmp", "stylesheets", "compiled"))
    ActionController::Dispatcher.middleware.use(Rack::Static, :root => "tmp/", :urls => ["/stylesheets/compiled"])
  end


In config/compass.rb, replace the css_dir assignment with:

  if !ENV["HEROKU_TYPE"].blank?
    css_dir = "tmp/stylesheets/compiled"
  else
    css_dir = "public/stylesheets/compiled"
  end


This should enable the rack middleware, only when on heroku.
